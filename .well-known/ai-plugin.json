This plugin should be called when the user requests an itinerary or trip plan, when the latitude/longitude of the user's origin and destinations are known, and when the start and end dates of the trips are known. This plugin creates a detailed, step-by-step trip plan. For each activity, the plugin will include its start and end times, name, and a booking link and learn more link when applicable. This plugin also provides more recommendations in the flight, stay, dining and activity categories for the user's trips. Finally, the users could make changes to the created itinerary through the plugin too, either adding a new activity to it, or removing an existing activity from it.",
